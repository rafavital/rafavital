👋 Hey there! I'm a 25 year old software engineer with a passion for building cool stuff. 🖥️
My pronouns are He/Him and They/Them! 

I graduated from Universidade Federal do Estado da Bahia (UNEB) with a degree in Digital Games in 2020. 👾  After that I decided to delve deeper into the world of Data and AI and earned my post-graduate degree in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence from the Pontifícia Universidade do Rio Grande do Sul (PUCRS) in 2024. 📊

Currently, I'm putting my skills to work at Serviço Federal de Processamento de Dados (Serpro), Brazil's largest public tech company. 🚀 I'm proud to be part of a team that develops digital solutions for the people and contributes to developing amazing, private and secure solutions. 🇧🇷

When I'm not coding, you can find me ~~getitng crushed by~~ catching waves 🏄‍♂️, tending to my garden 🪴, or tinkering with my homelab 🖥️. 

Feel free to reach out to me! 😊
